## Take-aways

- Highly efficient leaders often lose their focus on people due to a limiting belief that more people-focused activities will slow them down and impede their ability to execute, and to ultimately be successful.
- The result is often a negative impact on organizational climate and burnout of team members. In a 2017 study by Kronos and Future Workplace, burnout was highlighted as the biggest threat to employee engagement, with 95% of HR leaders citing it as a key driver of employee turnover.
- Great leaders are able to balance task-focus (getting things done) with people-focus (inspiring, developing, and empowering others).
- If you sense that you may be overly task-focused, here are some suggestions to re-set your priorities: Get feedback. Identify high-value ways to focus on people. Engage in self-observation and reflection. De-bunk your limiting beliefs. Practice self-management.
